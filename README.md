## Abstract

A simple, static webpage in the format of a technical documentation page introducing the reader to mathematical typesetting in the LaTeX markup language.

## Skills

- Building a static web page using HTML.
- Utilising CSS to create a stylesheet.
- Using media rules to add responsive design to a page.

## Background

This project was part of the Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp.org. I chose to make a webpage about writing mathematical equations in LaTeX because, at the time, I was using LaTeX to take notes for an online maths course. As with other projects from freeCodeCamp, the webpage had to meet a list of requirements known as user stories. For more information, check out the link at the end of this page.
